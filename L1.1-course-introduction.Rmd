## Meet your TA!

**Name Missing**

**Photo Missing**

## Meet your classmates!

Get to know your neighbour! Choose someone to go first. In [2 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48z7nQaehWI), share:

- Your name
- Your program
- Something notable you did over the summer

Then switch for another two minutes.

Afterwards: let's here from a few of you - tell us something you learned!

# The syllabus

Let's go over the [syllabus](https://emse6574-gwu.github.io/2019-Fall/) and the course assignments.

# Course Mantras

Here are some philosophies that will get you far in data analytic work. We will be revisiting these over and over again.

- Embrace plain text (as opposed to rich text).
- Everything you do should be reproducible.

**Example**: RMarkdown -> HTML. This webpage was generated from [this markdown source file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emse6574-gwu/2019-Fall/master/L1.1-course-introduction.Rmd) on GitHub.

If you want to generate the HTML page, download the `.Rmd` file and run the following code in R:

```{r eval=FALSE}
rmarkdown::render('./L1.1-course-introduction.Rmd')
```

# Getting Help

Sign up for Piazza [HERE](piazza.com/gwu/fall2019/emse6574)

- [**Piazza**](piazza.com/gwu/fall2019/emse6574): Piazza can be used to ask quick questions and receive quick responses without attending office hours in person. This also enables other students to see answers to common questions. Questions on Piazza should be specific and include all needed information. For example, if your code has an error you don't understand, **include the code and the error message** in your question.
- **Office Hours**: Office hours let you ask questions to TAs and professors directly, and can help you understand concepts and debug programs that you're struggling with alone.
