Having successfully completed this course, students will be able to:

- Write clear, robust, and reasonably efficient code in R using:
    - Sequential, conditional, and loop statements.
    - Multiple data types, including numeric, string, and logical data.
    - Data structures, including vectors and data frames.
    - Visualizations of data.

- Develop simple programs to effectively solve medium-sized tasks by:
    - Employing modular, top-down design in program construction.
    - Demonstrating an effective programming style based on established standards, practices, and guidelines.
    - Proactively creating and writing test cases to test and debug code.
    - Applying computational problem-solving skills to new problems.

- Import, manipulate, visualize, and export data in R.
