This course provides a foundation in programming using the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/). Emphasis will be on producing clear, robust, and reasonably efficient code using top-down design, informal analysis, and effective testing and debugging. Throughout the course, students will primarily work on individual programming assignments to help practice problem solving skills, coding skills, and data science skills. Students will be assessed through quizzes, homework assignments, and exams. Teaching will involve interactive lectures with plenty of time spent live coding. This course assumes no prior programming experience and is an ideal preparation for higher level courses in data analytics.
