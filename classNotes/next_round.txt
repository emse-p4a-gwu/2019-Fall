General:
- Add early discussion of Polya problem solving: Solve problem before coding - come up with a plan, then execute the code
- Change homework assignment instructions to use GWnet ID name in .R file name

3-Functions:
- Include the `almostEqual()` function in the classNotes

5-Loops:
- Greater discussion of iteration in each loop type, esp. with while loops
- Use the walkThroughDigits(n) function first before going on to isPrime

Vectors:
- Add %in%

Potential New Topics:
- Lecture on building a program. Abstracting away functions that can be repeatedly used, and otherwise good programming practices: https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/coding-habits-data-scientists
- Lecture on building a package (potentially instead of monte carlo lecture).
