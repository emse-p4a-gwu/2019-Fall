## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see [rmarkdown.rstudio.com](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

# Markdown practice

This is a markdown sentence. Some words are in *italics*, others in **bold**, and some are ***both***! Finally, some are written in `code formatting`. Here is a markdown table:

Animal | Sound
---|-------
Dog      | Woof
Ca |       Meow
Cow | Moo



The value of pi is `r pi`

2+2 is equal to `r 2+2`

This is a sentence

```{r name, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# this is a comment
myobject  <- 2+2
myobject
```


```{r barplot, fig.height=3, fig.width=5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = bears) +
    geom_bar(aes(x = month, fill = bearType))
```

Here are all the bear stories:

```{r}
bears %>%
    select(description) %>% 
    kable()
```


```{python}
"here is one" + " sentence"
```
