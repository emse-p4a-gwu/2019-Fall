# Simple questions

**Question 1**: Which months have the highest and lowest number of bird impacts with aircraft?

To identify this, I will count the number of observations in each month:

```{r}
birds %>% 
    count(incident_month) %>% 
    arrange(n) %>% 
    kable()
```

And here's a visual summary:

```{r}
birds %>% 
    ggplot() +
    geom_bar(aes(x = as.factor(incident_month)))
```
