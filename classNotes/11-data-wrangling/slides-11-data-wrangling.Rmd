# The main `dplyr` verbs

- `select()`: subset columns
- `filter()`: subset rows on conditions
- `arrange()`: sort results
- `mutate()`: create new columns by using information from other columns
- `group_by()`: group data to perform grouped operations
- `summarize()`: create summary statistics (usually on grouped data)
- `count()`: count discrete rows

# This week's British Band: The Spice Girls

```{r}

    firstName   = c("Melanie", "Melanie", "Emma", "Geri", "Victoria"),
    lastName    = c("Brown", "Chisholm", "Bunton", "Halliwell", "Beckham"),

# Practice: `select` columns, `filter` rows

Data: Wildlife impacts data (we saw this last week)
<br>
<br>

1) Create the data frame object `df` by using `file.path()` and `read_csv()` to load the `wildlife_impacts.csv` file that is in the `data` folder.
<br>
<br>

2) Use the `df` object and the `select()` and `filter()` functions to answer the following questions:

- Create a new data frame, `df_birds`, that contains only the variables (columns) about the species of bird.
- Create a new data frame, `dc`, that contains only the observations (rows) from DC airports.
- Create a new data frame, `dc_birds_known`, that contains only the observations (rows) from DC airports and those where the species of bird is known.
- How many _known_ unique species of birds have been involved in accidents at DC airports?

# Practice: `select`, `filter`, and `%>%`

Data: Wildlife impacts data
<br>
<br>

1) Create the data frame object `df` by using `file.path()` and `read_csv()` to load the `wildlife_impacts.csv` file that is in the `data` folder.
<br>
<br>

2) Use the `df` object and the `select()` and `filter()` functions to answer the following questions:

- Create a new data frame, `dc_dawn`, that contains only the observations (rows) from DC airports that occurred at dawn.
- Create a new data frame, `dc_dawn_birds`, that contains only the observations (rows) from DC airports that occurred at dawn and only the variables (columns) about the species of bird.
- Create a new data frame, `dc_dawn_birds_known`, that contains only the observations (rows) from DC airports that occurred at dawn and only the variables (columns) about the KNOWN species of bird.
- How many _known_ unique species of birds have been involved in accidents at DC airports at dawn?

# Sort rows with `arrange()`

--
Sort the data frame by year of birth:
```{r}
spicegirls %>%
    arrange(yearOfBirth)
```

---
# Sort rows with `arrange()`

Use the `desc()` function to sort in descending order:
```{r}
spicegirls %>%
    arrange(desc(yearOfBirth))
```

---
# Sort rows with `arrange()`

Example of filtering, arranging, and selecting:

```{r}
spicegirls %>%
    filter(yearOfBirth < 1975) %>%
    arrange(desc(yearOfBirth)) %>%
    select(ends_with('name'))
```

# You can immediately use new variables

```{r}
spicegirls %>%
    select(firstName, lastName, yearOfBirth) %>%
    mutate(
        age      = 2019 - yearOfBirth,
        meanAge  = mean(age),
        youngest = (age == min(age)),
        oldest   = (age == max(age)))
```

---
# if/else statements with `ifelse()`

To create a new variable based on a condition, use `ifelse()`
<br>
`ifelse(<condition>, <if TRUE>, <else>)`
<br>
--
```{r}
spicegirls %>%
    mutate(
        bornEvenOrOdd = ifelse(yearOfBirth %% 2 == 0, 'even', 'odd'))
```

# Practice: `mutate`

Data: Wildlife impacts data
<br>
<br>

1) Create the data frame object `df` by using `file.path()` and `read_csv()` to load the `wildlife_impacts.csv` file that is in the `data` folder.
<br>
<br>

2) Use the `df` object and the `mutate()` functions to add the following new variables:

- `height_miles`: The `height` variable converted to miles (Hint: there are 5,280 feet in a mile).
- `cost_mil`: `TRUE` if the repair costs was greater or equal to $1 million, `FALSE` otherwise.

BONUS: Use the `incident_month` variable to create a new variable `season`, which takes one of four values based on the incident month:

- `spring`: March, April, May
- `summer`: June, July, August
- `fall`: September, October, November
- `winter`: December, January, February

# Split-apply-combine with `group_by`

### 1. **Split** the data into groups
<br>

### 2. **Apply** some analysis to each group
<br>

### 3. **Combine** the results

# Practice: `group_by` + `summarise`

Data: Wildlife impacts data
<br>
<br>

1) Create the data frame object `df` by using `file.path()` and `read_csv()` to load the `wildlife_impacts.csv` file that is in the `data` folder.
<br>
<br>

2) Use the `df` object and the `group_by()` and `summarise` functions to answer the following questions:

- Create a summary data frame that contains the mean `height` for each different time of day.
- Create a summary data frame that contains the maximum `cost_repairs_infl_adj` for each year.

# Count observations with `count()`

Example: How many members are in each band?
<br>
--
```{r}
bands %>%
    group_by(band) %>%
    summarise(count = n())

---
# Count observations with `count()`

Same thing, but faster:
<br>
```{r}
bands %>%
    count(band)
```

---
# Count observations with `count()`

Counting *combinations of variables*:
<br>
```{r}
bands %>%
    mutate(startsWithG = str_detect(firstName, '^G')) %>%
    count(band, startsWithG)
```

---
# Practice: `count`

Data: Wildlife impacts data
<br>
<br>

1) Create the data frame object `df` by using `file.path()` and `read_csv()` to load the `wildlife_impacts.csv` file that is in the `data` folder.
<br>
<br>

2) Use the `df` object and the `count()` function to answer the following questions:

- Which month has had the greatest number of reported incidents?
- Which year has had the greatest number of reported incidents?

---
# Exporting data

Use `filePath()` + `write_csv()`
<br>

```{r}
ageSummary <- bands %>%
    mutate(age = 2019 - yearOfBirth) %>%
    group_by(band) %>%
    summarise(
        mean_age = mean(age),
        min_age = min(age),
        max_age = max(age))
ageSummary
```

---
# Exporting data

<br>
Save the `ageSummary` data frame in your "data" folder:
<br>
```{r, eval=FALSE}
savePath <- file.path('data', 'ageSummary.csv')
write_csv(ageSummary, savePath)
```
