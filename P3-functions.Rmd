```{r setup, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rm(list=objects()) # start with a clean workspace
source("knitr_setup.R")
```

Read these instructions first!

You may not use loops or conditionals (which we haven't covered yet).

# Mystery Functions

In just a few words of plain English, what does each of the following functions do? Provide some explanation for your answer.

```
f <- function(x, y) {
    epsilon = 0.0000001
    d1 = abs(x)**2
    d2 = abs(y)**0.5
    return(abs(d1 - d2) < epsilon)
}

g <- function(x) { 
    return(is.integer(x) & (x / 10 == x %% 10))
} 
 
h <- function(x) { 
    return(is.integer(x) & (x >= 0) & ((as.integer(round(x**0.5)))^2 == x))
} 
```
