Read these instructions first!

You may not use loops or conditionals (which we haven't covered yet).

# Mystery Functions

In just a few words of plain English, what does each of the following functions do? Provide some explanation for your answer.

```
f <- function(x, y) {
    epsilon = 0.0000001
    d1 = abs(x)**2
    d2 = abs(y)**0.5
    return(abs(d1 - d2) < epsilon)
}

g <- function(x) { 
    return(is.integer(x) & (x %/% 10 == x %% 10))
} 
 
h <- function(x) { 
    return(is.integer(x) & (x >= 0) & ((as.integer(round(x**0.5)))^2 == x))
} 
```

# Write functions

Here are a bunch of functions you should be able to write. Any of these may appear (directly or modified) on a quiz or exam!

## nthFibonacciNumber(n)

Write the function `nthFibonacciNumber(n)` that takes a positive integer `n` and (without using loops) returns the nth [Fibonacci number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number). Your function should do this:

Input                 | Output
----------------------| -------
nthFibonacciNumber(1) | 1
nthFibonacciNumber(2) | 1
nthFibonacciNumber(3) | 2
nthFibonacciNumber(4) | 3
nthFibonacciNumber(5) | 5
nthFibonacciNumber(6) | 8
   
## integerSquareRoot(x)

Given a non-negative integer `x`, return the integer value that is closest to its square root.  For example, `integerSquareRoot(10)` returns `3`.
 
## celsiusToFahrenheit(degrees)

Given a temperature in Celsius, return the same temperature in Fahrenheit.  So `celsiusToFahrenheit(0)` returns `32`, and `celsiusToFahrenheit(100)` returns `212`.
 
## isRightTriangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)

Given six numeric values representing the points `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, and `(x3, y3)`, return `TRUE` if the triangle formed by connecting the 3 points is a right triangle, and `FALSE` otherwise.  You may ignore the case where the 3 points are collinear (and so do not form a triangle). Hint:  Herod's Formula.
 
## triangleArea(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)
Given six numeric values representing the points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3), return the area of the triangle formed by connecting the 3 points.  You may ignore the case where the 3 points are collinear (and so do not form a triangle).  Hint:  [Herod's Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula).
 
## dcHour(londonHour)
This function takes an integer, the current hour in London, and returns the current hour in Washington DC (which is 5 hours behind London). However, London time is given in 24-hour time (so `londonHour` is between 0 and 23, inclusive), but Washington DC time must be returned in 12-hour time (so the result must be between 1 and 12, inclusive, where "am" and "pm" are ignored). Here are some examples:

`londonHour` | `dcHour(londonHour)`
-------------| -------------------
0 (midnight) | 7 (7pm)
10 (10am)    | 5 (5am)
12 (noon)    | 7 (7am)
17 (5pm)     | 12 (noon)
18 (6pm)     | 1 (1pm)

Note: the hardest part is when it is 12 o'clock in Pittsburgh.
