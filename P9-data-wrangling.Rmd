The best way to improve your data wrangling skills is to practice them will actual datasets. To facilitate that practice, I highly recommend you go through some free online tutorials. Here are some good ones:

- [Getting Started with the Tidyverse](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tidyverse-tutorial-r), by Hugo Bowne-Anderson. Dataset: _Passengers on the Titanic_
- [Good `dplyr` overview](https://riptutorial.com/r/topic/4250/dplyr), by riptutorial.com
