<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Unofficial Description</h2>
<p>This course provides a foundation in programming using the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R programming language</a>. Emphasis will be on producing clear, robust, and reasonably efficient code using top-down design, informal analysis, and effective testing and debugging. Throughout the course, students will primarily work on individual programming assignments to help practice coding skills. Students will be assessed through quizzes, exams, and a final project. Teaching will involve interactive lectures and recitations with a lot time spent live coding. At the end of the semester, students will demonstrate mastery of the course’s topics by working on a 3-week team project. This course assumes no prior programming experience and will prepare students for higher level courses in data analytics.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Homework Assignments</h2>
<p>Homework assignments contain a mix of coding exercises (reading, debugging, and writing code) and written exercises. They generally assess the material taught the week they are assigned, and should take several hours to complete. You are <strong>strongly</strong> encouraged to start the homeworks early (Tuesday is best, and Thursday at the latest!) and come to office hours for help when needed.</p>
<p>Read the <a href="#collaboration-policy">Collaboration Policy</a> about collaborating with fellow students on homeworks. While most problems must be worked on individually, some will be marked as collaborative; on these problems (and <em>only</em> these problems), you may work on code with other students.</p>
<p>Assignments will be graded based on style (modularity, readability, commenting, etc.) and functionality (correctness on all possible test inputs). Your code should be properly annotated with comments that are well-placed, concise, and informative. Your assignments will be graded by your TA, by automated graders, and at times by your instructor.</p>
</div>
<div id="assessments" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Assessments</h2>
<p><strong>Quizzes</strong>:</p>
<p>Quizzes will be given about once every two weeks immediately at the beginning of class. Quizzes cover material from the previous week and the previous homework assignment. Quizzes are designed to be time-intensive, to test for fluency, and to demonstrate where additional study is needed.</p>
<p><strong>Midterm Exams</strong>:</p>
<p>There will be two midterm exams given in class, as noted in the course schedule. Each exam will cover only material presented in the preceding weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Final Exam</strong>:</p>
<p>There will be a standard final exam during the final exam period at the end of the semester. This exam will cover material from the entire semester. The final exam is built to allow enough time to attempt all problems.</p>

<div id="class-participation" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Class Participation</h2>
<p>Regular class attendance is essential. Much of the class time will be spent doing exercises and coding. Multiple absences, inappropriate or unprofessional behavior during class (such as monopolizing discussions or being rude or disruptive), not participating in classroom exercises, and not being prepared for class will result in a lower grade for the class participation component. As a rule of thumb, the participation grade will be assigned according to the following rubric:</p>
<table>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.4.2</span> AMD Grading</h3>
<p>This Alternative Minimum Grading (AMG) policy is available to everybody, but is designed specifically for those students who struggle in the first part of the course, and then through sustained hard work and dedication manage to elevate their performance in the latter part of the course to a level that merits passing with a C, even if their Standard Grade might be lower than that.</p>
<p>In addition to the normal grading scale, we will separately compute your grade using the following scale. Students do not sign up for AMG grading. Every student will be considered both for Standard Grading and AMG, and their semester grade will be the higher of the two (where the highest grade via AMG is a C).</p>
<p>To compute your AMG score, first use the following to compute your raw score. If the resulting score is higher than a C, set it back to a C.</p>

<li>You cannot miss multiple class periods</li>
<li>You cannot miss multiple assignments or quizzes</li>
<li>You cannot violate the Collaboration Policy</li>

<div id="collaboration-policy" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.5</span> Collaboration Policy</h2>
<!-- This policy is mostly copied from the course 15-112 at Carnegie Mellon University -->
<p>Learning how to program is like learning how to ride a bicycle - to get better, you must practice writing code yourself. Therefore, we have a set of strict rules regarding what kind of collaboration is allowed, what counts as over-collaboration, and what counts as cheating.</p>
<p><strong>This section is long, but you should read all of it thoroughly, as we take collaboration and cheating very seriously in this course. To begin, here’s a summary</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write your own code.</li>
<li>Don’t look at other people’s code.</li>
<li>Don’t let other students look at your code.</li>
</ul>
<div id="good-collaboration" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.5.1</span> Good Collaboration</h3>
<p>For all homework assignments, students are encouraged to talk to each other about high-level concepts regarding the problems. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Going through existing test cases and discussing why an input results in a certain output.</li>
<li>Figuring out new input/output pairs for the problems.</li>
<li>Discussing which general concepts might be useful in solving a problem (conditionals, loops, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>For homework assignments, students may also receive lower-level help from the instructors. This includes everything mentioned above, and also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asking questions about how to build an algorithm for the problem.</li>
<li>Asking for debugging help with code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain parts of homework assignments may be labeled <strong>Collaborative</strong>. For these parts (and <em>only</em> these parts), students may also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sketch out algorithms on a whiteboard together.</li>
<li>To avoid copying the code, you should write up the solution together, discuss it, then erase the solution, wait a few minutes, and write up solutions individually.</li>
<li>Help each other debug specific parts of assignment code.</li>
<li>NOTE: do not ‘debug’ by telling a friend to try your approach instead! Help them figure out what is actually going wrong.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Outside of the homework assignments and course assessments, students may also help each other learn to a greater degree. This can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>General discussion of course concepts.</li>
<li>Detailed explanations of example code on the course website.</li>
<li>Collaboratively solving a practice problem, with any level of co-writing code and co-debugging.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="over-collaboration" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.5.2</span> Over-collaboration</h3>
<p>Certain actions on homework assignments are considered over-collaboration; this means that a student might have attempted to collaborate with good intentions, but ended up collaborating at a level that became unhelpful for learning. Over-collaboration on homework assignments can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building ‘psuedocode’ algorithms together on a whiteboard that are essentially full programs.</li>
<li>Explaining to a friend how to solve a problem in high-level terms by going through your own program line-by-line.</li>
<li>Helping a friend debug on a non-collaborative problem.</li>
<li>NOTE: It is fine to give a friend suggestions if they describe what error is being thrown or which input/output pair is failing, but you may not look at their code/have them read their code out loud.</li>
<li>Helping a friend debug on a collaborative problem by suggesting they use your own approach to the problem.</li>
<li>Collaborating with a student on a collaborative problem and then not including their name as a collaborator in the assignment writeup.</li>
<li>In the case that you have taken this course before, copying your own code from the previous time you took the course.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Over-collaboration results in a warning on the first offense, and a penalty on later offenses.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="cheating" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.5.3</span> Cheating</h3>
<p>Certain actions within the course are considered cheating - that is, presenting work not completed by yourself as if you wrote it, providing work to others, or receiving unauthorized help.</p>
<p>Cheating on homework assignments can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copying or stealing any amount of code from someone currently in the class or someone who has taken the class before.</li>
<li>NOTE: Copying is never okay, whether the code is provided electronically, visually, audibly, or on paper.</li>
<li>Providing code you have written for an assignment to anyone else in the class.</li>
<li>Again: never share your code with others in the class, including electronic sharing, showing someone code on your computer, verbally speaking the code, or writing down the code on paper.</li>
<li>Finding code online and using it in the assignment. One exception: you may use code from the course website.</li>
<li>Putting code solutions from the course assignments online.</li>
<li>Receiving code-level assistance from any person not associated with the course.</li>
<li>Getting someone else to write the assignment code for you.</li>
<li>Asking questions about the assignments on any online services outside of the course office hours and course Piazza.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cheating on quizzes, midterms, or the final can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Referring to any external resources while completing the assessment (phones, notes, etc.).</li>
<li>Copying part of an answer off of another student’s paper, even if it is very small.</li>
<li>Using solutions provided by students who previously took the course.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cheating results in a penalty on the first offense, and failing the course on the second offense.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="penalties" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.5.4</span> Penalties</h3>
<p>Penalties are decided by the course instructors, and can vary based on the severity of the offense. Possible penalties include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Receiving a 0 on the assignment/quiz in question.</li>
<li>Receiving a -100 on the assignment/quiz in question.</li>
<li>Receiving a full letter grade deduction in the course.</li>
<li>Automatically failing the course.</li>
</ul>
<p>Penalties may also be accompanied by a letter to the Dean of Student Affairs, again at the instructors’ discretion. This can lead to university-level penalties, such as being suspended or expelled.</p>
</div>
<div id="plagiarism-detection" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.5.5</span> Plagiarism Detection</h3>
<p>Programs are naturally structured, which makes them much easier to compare than hand-written work, and easier to compare than typed essays. We run an automated plagiarism detection system on all assignments to detect copied code. Even if you make many changes to a copied code, it is <em>excessively</em> easy to detect copied code.</p>
<p><strong>In short, if you copy code, we will be able to tell - don’t copy code!</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="grace-period" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.5.6</span> Grace Period</h3>
<p>Your first year of college is a time when you do a lot of learning. Sometimes, you might make bad decisions or mistakes. The most important thing for you to do is to learn from your mistakes, to constantly grow, and become a better person.</p>
<p>Sometimes, students panic and copy code right before the deadline, then regret what they did afterwards. Therefore, you may rescind any homework submission for up to 24 hours after the deadline with no questions asked. Simply email the course instructors asking to delete the submission in question, and we will do so. Deleted submissions will not be considered during plagiarism detection, though of course they will also not be graded. However, it will always be better to get a 0 (or partial credit) on an assignment than to get a cheating violation!</p>
