Try answering some of these questions **before** running any code - reason through the commands, then run the code and see if you were correct:

- What do you think this will return: `3.1415 %% 1`
- What do you think this will return: `3.1415 %/% 1`
- What do you think this will return: `123456 %% 100`
- What do you think this will return: `123456 %/% 100`
- What do you think this will return: `! (TRUE | FALSE) & (FALSE | TRUE)`
