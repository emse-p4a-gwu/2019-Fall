## Meet your TA!

## Meet your classmates!

Get to know your neighbour! Choose someone to go first. In [2 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48z7nQaehWI), share:

- Your name
- Your program
- Something notable you did over the summer

Then switch for another two minutes.

Afterwards: let's here from a few of you - tell us something you learned!

# The syllabus

Let's go over the [syllabus](https://emse6574-gwu.github.io/2019-Fall/) and the course assignments. 

# Course Mantras

Here are some philosophies that will get you far in data analytic work. We will be revisiting these over and over again. 

- Embrace plain text (as opposed to rich text). 
- Everything you do should be reproducible.

__Example__: RMarkdown -> HTML. This webpage was generated from [this markdown source file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emse6574-gwu/2019-Fall/master/getting-started.Rmd) on GitHub. 

If you want to generate the HTML page, download the `.Rmd` file and run the following code in R:

```{r eval=FALSE}
rmarkdown::render('./getting-started.Rmd')
```
