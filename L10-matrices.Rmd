A matrix is a two dimensional data structure in R. Matrices are similar to vectors, but have both rows and columns. Just like vectors, matrices can only contain one data type.

# Creating a matrix

## The `matrix()` function

A matrix can be created using the `matrix()` function, which takes a vector of values and formats them into rows and columns by using the `nrow` and `ncol` arguments.

```{r}
a <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
a
```

Providing a value for both dimensions is not necessary. If one of the dimension is provided, the other is inferred from length of the vector:

```{r}
# For the 10-element vector, the argument `ncol = 2` implies that there must be 5 rows:
b <- matrix(1:10, ncol = 2)
b
```

If you provide no dimensions, the matrix will by default have just 1 column:


```{r}
c <- matrix(1:5)
c
```

By default, the `matrix()` function populates the matrix column-wise, meaning it fills in the values in the left-most column first (from top to bottom), then continues in the 2nd column, and so on. You can swap this to fill row-wise by using `byrow = TRUE`:

```{r}
d <- matrix(1:10, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
d
```

## The `cbind()` and `rbind()` functions

Another way of creating a matrix is by using the functions `cbind()` and `rbind()`, which stand for "column bind" and "row bind". These can be used to "bind" together vectors or other matrices:

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
y <- c(4, 5, 6)
```
```{r}
e <- cbind(x, y)
e
```
```{r}
f <- rbind(x, y)
f
```

## Dimensions

You can check the dimensions of any matrix by using the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions (which give the number of rows and columns, respectively), or the `dim()` function, which returns a vector containing the number of rows and columns:

```{r}
nrow(b) # Returns the number of rows
ncol(b) # Returns the number of columns
dim(b) # Returns a vector of the number rows and columns (in that order)
```

You can also create a matrix from a vector by setting its dimension using the `dim()` function (though I almost never do this):

```{r}
g <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
dim(g) <- c(2, 3)
g
```

# Accessing elements in a matrix

Just like with [vectors](L6-vectors.html#2_accessing_elements_in_a_vector), you can access elements in a matrix using brackets `[]` and indices inside the brackets. The general form is:

```
MATRIX[ROWS, COLUMNS]
```

The most common way is to use integer indices, but you can also use character indices (by naming each row and column) and logical indices.

## Using integer indices

To index with integers, we specify the row numbers and column numbers as vectors.

```{r}
a
a[1, 2] # Select the element in row 1, column 2
a[c(1, 2), c(2, 3)] # Select the elements in rows 1 & 2 and columns 2 & 3
a[1:2, 2:3] # You can also use the ":" operator to create vectors
```

If you leave either the row or column index blank, it means "selects all":

```{r}
a[c(1, 2),] # Leaving the column index blank will select all columns
a[,c(1, 2)] # Leaving the row index blank will select all rows
```

You can also use negative integers to specify rows or columns to be excluded:

```{r}
a[-1, ] # Select all rows and except the first
```

One thing to note is that if the matrix returned after indexing has only one row or one column, the result is returned as a vector, not a matrix:

```{r}
z <- a[1, ]
z
class(z)
```

You can avoid this by adding the argument `drop = FALSE` while indexing:

```{r}
z <- a[1, , drop = FALSE]
z
class(z)
```

## Using characters indices

Just like with [vectors](L6-vectors.html#22_using_characters_indices), you can name the elements in a matrix by naming the columns and / or rows with the `colnames()` and `rownames()` functions, and then use those names to access elements:

```{r}
colnames(a) <- c('one', 'two', 'three')
rownames(a) <- c('a', 'b', 'c')
a[c('a', 'b'), c('one', 'two')]
```

## Using logical indices

Just like with [vectors](L6-vectors.html#23_using_logical_indices), when using a logical vector for indexing, the position where the logical vector is `TRUE` is returned. This is helpful for filtering matrices based on conditions:

```{r}
a[a > 5] # Select elements greater than 5
a[a %% 2 == 0] # Select even elements
a[,(1:ncol(a)) %% 2 == 1] # Select the odd columns
```

---

# Modifying matrices

Using the above methods for accessing elements of a matrix, you can modify elements in matrices by just adding an assignment operator (`<-`):

```{r}
a[1, 1] <- 10 # Modify a single element
a
a[a > 5] <- 0 # Modify elements greater than 5
a
```

You can also [transpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose){target="_blank"} a matrix using the `t()` function:

```{r}
t(a)
```

Finally, you can add additional rows or columns using the `rbind()` and `cbind()` functions:

```{r}
cbind(a, c(1, 2, 3)) # Add a column
rbind(a, c(4, 5, 6)) # Add a row
```

# Matrix math

## Basic arithmetic operations

Just like with [vectorized operations](L6-vectors.html#3_vectorized_operations), matrices also perform most arithmetic operations on each element in the matrix.

```{r}
a <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
b <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
# Addition
a + b
# Subtraction
a - b
# Multiplication
a * b
# Division
a / b
```

When performing operations on matrices, the dimensions need to match:

```{r, error=TRUE}
c <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
a + c
```

You can also use single values to scale or shift all the elements in a matrix:

```{r, error=TRUE}
2 * a # Scale by factor of 2
2 + a # Shift by value of 2
```

## Linear algebra

One of the more powerful things you can do with matrices is [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra){target="_blank"}. For example, you can compute a sum-product (aka "[dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product){target="_blank"}") operation with a single matrix multiplication command using the `%*%` operator:

```{r}
a <- matrix(c(1, 3, -5), nrow=1)
b <- matrix(c(4, -2, -1), ncol=1)
a %*% b
```

To invert a matrix (a common linear algebra operation), use the `solve()` function:

```{r}
a <- matrix(c(2,3,2,1,2,1,1,1,2), nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
solve(a)
```
